|    1    | Heuristic        | Aesthetic-Usability Effect  | Users often perceive aestethically pleasing design as design that's more usable.                |   Aesthetic       |                              |
|    2    | Heuristic        | Fitt's Law                  |  The time to acquire a target is a function of the distance to and size of the target.               |          |                              |
|    3    | Heuristic        | Goal-Gradient Effect        |   The tendency to approach a goal increases with proximity to the goal.               |          |                              |
|    4    | Heuristic        | Hick's Law                  | The time it takes to make a decision increases with the number and complexity of choices.                 |          |                              |
|    5    | Heuristic        | Jakob's Law                 | User spends most of their time on other sites. This means that users prefer your site to work the same way as all the other sites they know.               |          |                              |
|    6    | Heuristic        | Miller's Law                | The average person can only keep 7 (plus or minus 2) items in their working memory.                 |          |                              |
|    7    | Heuristic        | Parkinson's Law             | Any task will inflate until all of the available time is spent.                |          |                              |

|    1    | Principle        | Doherty Treshold            | Productivity soars when a computer and its users interact at pace (<400 ms) that ensures that neither has to wait on the other.                |          |                              |
|    2    | Principle        | Occam's Razor               | Among competing hypotheses that predict equally well, the one with the fewest assumptions should be selected.                |          |                              |
|   3    | Principle        | Pareto Principle            | The Pareto Principle states that for many events, roughly 80% of the effect come from 20% of the causes.                  |  80:20        |                              |
|   4    | Principle        | Postel's Law                | Be liberal in what you accept, and conservative in what you send.                |          |                              |
|   5    | Principle        | Tesler's Law                | For any system, there is a certain amount of complexity which cannot be reduced.                |          |                              |

|   1    | Gestalt          | Law of Common Region        | Elements tend to be perceived into groups if they are sharing an area with a clearly defined boundary.                |          |                              |
|   14    | Gestalt          | Law of Proximity            |   Objects that are near, or proximate to each other, tend to be grouped together.              |          |                              |
|   15    | Gestalt          | Law of PrÃ¤gnanz             | People will perceive and interpret ambiguous or complex images as the simplest form possible, because it is the interpelation that requires the least cognitive effort of us.                |          |                              |
|   16    | Gestalt          | Law of Similarity           | The human eyes tend to perceive similar elements in a design as a complete picture, shape, or group, even if those elements are separated.                |          |                              |
|   17    | Gestalt          | Law of Uniform Connectedness|  Elements that are visually connected are perceived as more related than elements with no connection.               |          |                              |
|   18    | Cognitive Bias   | Peak-End Rule               | People judge an experience largely based on how they felt at its peak and its end, rather than total the total sum or average of every moment of the experience.                 |          |                              |
|   19    | Cognitive Bias   | Serial Position Effect      | Users have a propensity to best remember the first and last items in a series.                |          |                              |
|   20    | Cognitive Bias   | Von Restorff Effect         | The Von Restorff Effect, also known as The Isolation Effect, predicts that when multiple similar objects are present, the one that differs from the rest is most likely to be remembered.                |          |                              |
|   21    | Cognitive Bias   | Zeigarnik Effect            | People remember uncompleted or interrupted tasks better than completed tasks.         |          |                              |
