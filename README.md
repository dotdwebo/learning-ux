|-------  |------------------|---------------------------  |-----------------|----------|------------------------------|
|    1    | Heuristic        | Aesthetic-Usability Effect  | Users often perceive aestethically pleasing design as design that's more usable.                |          |                              |
|    2    | Heuristic        | Fitt's Law                  |  The time to acquire a target is a function of the distance to and size of the target.               |          |                              |
|    3    | Heuristic        | Goal-Gradient Effect        |   The tendency to approach a goal increases with proximity to the goal.               |          |                              |
|    4    | Heuristic        | Hick's Law                  | The time it takes to make a decision increases with the number and complexity of choices.                 |          |                              |
|    5    | Heuristic        | Jakob's Law                 | User spends most of their time on other sites. This means that users prefer your site to work the same way as all the other sites they know.               |          |                              |
|    6    | Heuristic        | Miller's Law                | The average person can only keep 7 (plus or minus 2) items in their working memory.                 |          |                              |
|    7    | Heuristic        | Parkinson's Law             | Any task will inflate until all of the available time is spent.                |          |                              |
|    8    | Principle        | Doherty Treshold            | Productivity soars when a computer and its users interact at pace (<400 ms) that ensures that neither has to wait on the other.                |          |                              |
|    9    | Principle        | Occam's Razor               | Among competing hypotheses that predict equally well, the one with the fewest assumptions should be selected.                |          |                              |
|   10    | Principle        | Pareto Principle            | The Pareto Principle states that for many events, roughly 80% of the effect come from 20% of the causes.                  |          |                              |
|   11    | Principle        | Postel's Law                | Be liberal in what you accept, and conservative in what you send.                |          |                              |
|   12    | Principle        | Tesler's Law                | For any system, there is a certain amount of complexity which cannot be reduced.                |          |                              |
|   13    | Gestalt          | Law of Common Region        | Elements tend to be perceived into groups if they are sharing an area with a clearly defined boundary.                |          |                              |
|   14    | Gestalt          | Law of Proximity            |   Objects that are near, or proximate to each other, tend to be grouped together.              |          |                              |
|   15    | Gestalt          | Law of Pragnanz             |                 |          |                              |

|   17    | Gestalt          | Law of Uniform Connectedness|                 |          |                              |
